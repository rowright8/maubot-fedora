### Added

- Send a Fedora Messaging message when a cookie is given [#20](https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-fedora/issues/20)


### Changed

- Changed the `!oncall` command (and associated subcommands) to `!infra oncall`. Additionally, added
  the new `!infra oncall list` command that returns the list of sysadmins that are on call, and this
  command is now aliased to `!oncall` [#26](https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-fedora/issues/26)
- added additional information to pagure ticket commands, including
  assignee, ticket close status, and dates of opening, modification,
  and closure. [#39](https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-fedora/issues/39)
- the component of a bugzilla bug is now included in the reply when using the !bug command.
  For example, previously where the reply was `RHBZ#2245223: Please update to 4.6.0` the !bug command
  will return `RHBZ#2245223: [python-pebble]: Please update to 4.6.0` [#42](https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-fedora/issues/42)


### Fixed

- Don't allow users to give cookies to themselves [#16](https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-fedora/issues/16)
- When gifting a cookie, the bot responds with "1 cookie" or "2 cookies"
  instead of "1 cookie(s)" or "2 cookie(s)". [#36](https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-fedora/issues/36)
